# Student-Details-EDA
This project is focused on practicing data cleaning and visualization techniques using Python libraries. As part of my learning journey in data analytics, I have explored various methods to prepare and present data effectively. This project serves as a foundation for future work, where I plan to contribute more advanced and diverse visualizations, building upon the insights and techniques developed here.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
Data Cleaning: Efficiently processed and cleaned raw data to make it suitable for analysis.
Data Visualization: Created insightful visualizations using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
<h2>Visualizations</h2>

<h2>Future Work</h2>
This project is just the beginning. I aim to expand on these techniques and introduce more sophisticated visualizations in future projects, 
using this work as a base for continued learning and improvement.
